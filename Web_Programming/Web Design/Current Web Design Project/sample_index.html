							<ul>
								<li class="center">Team Deathmatch - is where the first team to get to 7500 wins. Also, there is a 10 minute time limit
									and each kill is 100 points and the assits are 20 points.</li>
								<li class="center">Mercenary Team Death Match - is where the rules are like Team Deathmatch except there are no parties allowed
									and with random team mates. The score limit is 7500 and the time limit goes to 10 minutes. Each kill is 100 points
									and the assits are 20 points.</li>
								<li class="center">Free-For-All - is about where everyone is versing everyone else and there are no teammates. The time limit
									is 10 minutes long and the score limit to reach is 1500 points and each kill is 50 points and the assits
									are 10 points.</li>
								<li class="center">Domination - is where your team has to hold three bases or at least hold two bases most of the game so that 
									the first one to 200 points wins. The kills are worth 50 points and the assits are worth 20 points.</li>
								<li class="center">Ground War - is about Team Deathmatch and Domination. The Team Deathmatch score goes to 10,000 points
									and each kill is worth 50 points and assits are worth 20 points. The time limit for Team Deathmatch is 10 minutes long.
									The Domination score goes up to 200 and no time-limit. The main objective is to capture and hold all three flags.</li>
								<li class="center">Demolition - is about destroying the objects if on offense, or defend the objective(s) if on defense. 
									The game starts with 3 minutes on the clock. The offensive objective is to destroy targets A and B, where as the defense
									is trying to keep the targets in tact. To destroy a target, the offensive team needs to plant the bomb, which ever member
									holds and is unstoppable, at both targets, and have them blow up. Planting the bomb takes 5 seconds, the bomb timer lasts
									45 seconds, and the defuse time is 5 seconds. If a target is destroyed, 3 minutes are added onto the second round.</li>
								<li class="center">Sabotage - is where there is one bomb which is usuallylocated in the center of the map, two targets for each team. Each
									team has to destroy the other target. The planting time is 5 seconds while the defusing time is 5 seconds and the timer
									lasts for 45 seconds. There is two rounds; the normal round is 20 minutes long and have a 8 second respond time; but if
									you don't blow up the opponents target then you have overtime which is just like Search and Destroy. The overtime time
									limit lasts 2-3 minutes.</li>
								<li class="center">Headquarters Pro - is where you need to capture the headquarters and defend it from the enemy. Headquarters is a respawn
									mode in which your team must capture HQ points before the enemy team can. Once the game randomly selects the headquarters
									position, you and your team must get to it as quickly as possible and gain control of it. Take control of the headquarter
									by standing in the area of the headquarter until the progress bar appears. When the bar reaches full it means that you have
									successfully taken control of the headquarter point. Now you must defend it once you have secured the headquarter. Once
									you secure an headquarter, your team can no longer respawn. After the enemy destroys the headquarter, your team  regains
									the ability to respawn. The Pro addition stands for when the headquarter has been randomly selected by the game, it will
									not be become online (to capture) right away. Instead, both teams have time to get from one side of the map to the position
									of the next headquarter before it comes online.</li>
								<li class="center">Search and Destroy - is about where you have one life, so if you die your out for the round; oh yea you have to win four
									rounds to win the game. There are two bombs. One round, one team protect the bombs and the other team plants, and the next
									round its vice versa.</li>
								<li class="center">Barebones Pro - is where you play Team Deathmatch and Free-For-All. The killstreaks are disabled.</li>
								<li class="center">Team Tactical - is where there is a small based games of Team Deathmatch, Domination, Capture the Flag, Demolition, and
									Search and Destroy.</li>
								<li class="center">Hardcore Ricochet:SD - is where it is Hardcore Search and Destroy with richochet friendly fire. It also has Limited HUD,
									Extra bullet damage, and friendly fire is directed back at the shooter.</li>
								<li class="center">Hardcore Team Deathmatch - is where it has a limited HUD, Extra bullet damage, and Friendly Fire is on. The health count
									is in miniscule</li>
								<li class="center">3rd Person Team Tactical - Third person prospective with the game scenarios of Team Deathmatch, Domination, Capture the Flag,
									and Demolition.</li>
								<li class="center">Team Deathmatch Express - is with a shorter time but i heard its still ten minutes. The scorre is the same as 
									Team Deathmatch.</li>
								<li class="center">Objective Barebones Pro - is where you are playing Domination, Demolition, Headquarters Pro, and Capture the Flag. All
									Killstreaks rewards are disabled.</li>
								<li class="center">Hardcore Ricochet: HQ Pro - is where it is Headquarter Pro with hardcore Richochet rules.</li>
								<li class="center">Capture the Flag - There are three rounds. There are two main rounds; each round is five minutes long except overtime.
									There are two flags each team has there own. You have to return the opponents flag back to your flag to score a point. There
									is no score limit. Overtime has 3 minutes long. In Overtime the first one to get to the other teams flag wins; no return just
									grab in win. Each kill is worth 50 points and assits are worth 20 points.</li>

								<li class="description">You can get alot more kills in sabotage than any other scenarios.</li>
								<li class="description">Also, you can get alot more killstreaks in it too.</li>
								<li class="description">Each kill is worth 100 points instead of 50 points.</li>

						<div class="navigation-description">
							<ul>
								<li class="description">Some people decide to try to blow up the bomb at the begining of the game.</li>
								<li class="description">There are people who will just continuously try to plant the bomb, just so they can get more experience points.</li>
								<li class="description">If you lose in overtime then it ends up in a tie.</li>
								<li class="description">If you have random people on your team and they don't have mic's then there is a possibility that you won't win unless you can get them to cooperate.</li>
