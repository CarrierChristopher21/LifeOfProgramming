Game Rules:

<!--[if !supportLists]-->•     <!--[endif]-->Two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, 
	a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 ("pig") is rolled or the player holds and scores 
	the sum of the rolls. Die images are available for download on Angel. check

<!--[if !supportLists]-->•     <!--[endif]-->Starting player will alternate between human and computer 
	with the human being the first player of the series. check

<!--[if !supportLists]-->•     <!--[endif]-->At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced 
	with two decisions: check

<!--[if !supportLists]-->•     <!--[endif]-->The computer plays a "Keep Pace and End Race" policy as

	Summary: Implement a web based implementation for the game of Pig where the user plays a 
		succession of games against a computer player.

	 

		Game Rules:

		•     Two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a 
				die until either a 1 ("pig") is rolled or the player holds and scores the 
				sum of the rolls. Die images are available for download on Angel.

		•     Starting player will alternate between human and computer with the human being 
				the first player of the series.

		•     At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions:

		•     roll - If the player rolls a

		•     1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn.

		•     2 - 6: the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn 
				continues.

		•     hold - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the 
				opponent's turn.

		•     The computer plays a "Keep Pace and End Race" policy as follows: 
				Let the computer's hold value = 21 + round((user score - computer score) / 8). 
				If either player has 71 points or more, or if the turn total is less than the 
				hold value, then roll. Otherwise, hold.

		Visual Components:

		•     Buttons for Roll and Hold

		•     Ability to display

		•     Computer Score

		•     Player Score

		•     Turn Total

		•     Dice image
