						<p class="billiards">I am going to tell you some information about Billiards and my preference's of Billiards. Billiards
												can have up to 4 players per game. This game is can be played by yourself as well or you can play another player. The 
												game requires a even amount of players if your not playing by yourself.

											<li class="billiards">The 8 ball Scenario is a call shot game that requires a cue ball and 
												fifteen other balls, that are numbered from 1 to 15. One player must pocket balls of the group 
												numbered 1 to 7 which are solid colors. While the other player has 9 through 15 which are striped 
												the player pocketing his or her group first and then legally pocketing the 8-ball wins the game. 
												You have to call the exact pocket for the 8 ball or you lose.</li>
												
											<li class="billiards">When Racking the balls on the pool table for the 8 ball game. The balls 
												are racked in a triangle at the foot of the table with the 8-Ball in the center of the triangle. 
												The front ball of the rack has to be on the foot spot, and a stripe ball in one corner of the rack 
												and a solid ball in the other corner of the rack.</li>
													
											<li class="billiards">Place the 1 ball which is a solid yellow ball at the head of the rack, pointing 
												toward the center of the table, only if you're playing eight ball. The next ball goes slightly behind 
												the 1 ball on either side of it, and then the next set should both be striped balls. Followed by the 
												8-ball directly behind the two striped balls. In regular games, the remaining balls can 
												be placed into the rack in any order. In competition games, the balls should alternate 
												around the perimeter in a solid-stripe-solid-stripe manner</li>

								<ul>
									<li class="billiard-description">
										<ul>
											<li class="billiards">Nine Ball is required to have nine balls numbered from 1-9 and a cue 
												ball if you want to play this scenario. On each shot no matter the players turn, the first ball that 
												the cue ball hits must be the lowest-numbered ball on the table. The balls do not need to be pocketed
												in numbered order. If a player pockets any ball on a legal shot, then it remains his/her turn and 
												he/she may take another shot. You can continue shooting until he/she misses, fouls, or wins the game 
												by pocketing the 9-ball. After a miss, the incoming player must shoot from the position left by the 
												previous player, but after any foul the next player may start with the cue ball anywhere on the 
												table. Players are not required to call shots. A match will end when one of the players has won the 
												required number of games.</li>
											
											<li class="billiards">When racking the balls for the 9 ball game. The 9 ball uses a Diamond 
												Shaped rack so the balls are racked in a diamond shape, with the one ball at the front of the 
												diamond and the 1 ball is set on the foot spot. The nine ball goes in the center of the diamond, 
												and the other balls go in a random order, and are racked as tightly as possible. The game begins 
												with the cue ball in hand behind the head string. Place the 1 ball at the head of the rack for the 
												9 ball game; and put the 9 ball in the center of the rack. For non-competition games, the remaining 
												balls can be in any order, but for competition games the balls should be in ascending numerical 
												order counter-clockwise around the perimeter of the rack.</li>

									<li class="billiard-description">
										<ul>
											<li class="billiards">Snooker may be played by two or more players, either independently or as sides. 
												The game can be summarized as follows: </li>
											<li class="billiards">1.Each player uses the same White cue-ball and there are 21 balls - 15 Reds each 
												valued 1, and 6 colors: Yellow are valued 2, Green are 3, Brown are 4, Blue are 5, Pink are 6 and 
												Black are 7.</li>
											<li class="billiards">2.Scoring strokes in a player's turn are made by potting Reds and colors 
												alternately until all the Reds are off the table and then the colors in the ascending order of 
												their value.</li>
											<li class="billiards">3.Points awarded for scoring strokes are added to the score of the striker.</li>
											<li class="billiards">4.Penalty points from fouls are added to the opponent's score.</li>
											<li class="billiards">5.A tactic employed at any time during a frame is to leave the cue-ball behind 
												a ball not on such that it is snookered for the next player. If a player or side is more points 
												behind than are available from the balls left on the table, then the laying of snookers in the hope 
												of gaining points from fouls becomes most important.</li>
											<li class="billiards">6.The winner of a frame is the player or side (i) making the highest score,(ii) 
												to whom the frame is conceded, or (iii) to whom it is awarded.</li>
											<li class="billiards">7.The winner of a game is the player or side (i) winning most, or the required 
												number of frames (ii) winning most games or, aggregate points is relevant, with the greatest 
												total.</li>
