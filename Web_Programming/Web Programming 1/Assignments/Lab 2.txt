Create a function that will accept a single parameter, which should be a string, 
and will return the reverse of the string: If it is passed “Hello,” it will return “olleH.”

1. Start by creating a function named reverse and declare that it accepts a single parameter.

2. Check that the argument passed in is a string: If it is not, then throw an error for the caller.

3. Iterate through the string one character at a time using a for loop. 

4. Create a function will accept an array of numbers, and return true if the sum of all the positive numbers is greater than the 
	sum of the absolute value of all the negative numbers. Throw an error if not all of the items in the array are numbers.
